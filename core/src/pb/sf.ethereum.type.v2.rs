// @generated
/// Block is the representation of the tracing of a block in the Ethereum
/// blockchain. A block is a collection of \[TransactionTrace\] that are grouped
/// together and processed as an atomic unit. Each \[TransactionTrace\] is composed
/// of a series of \[Call\] (a.k.a internal transactions) and there is also at
/// least one call per transaction a.k.a the root call which essentially has the
/// same parameters as the transaction itself (e.g. `from`, `to`, `gas`, `value`,
/// etc.).
///
/// The exact tracing method used to build the block must be checked against
/// \[DetailLevel\] field. There is two levels of details available, `BASE` and
/// `EXTENDED`. The `BASE` level has been extracted using archive node RPC calls
/// and will contain only the block header, transaction receipts and event logs.
/// Refers to the Firehose service provider to know which blocks are offered on
/// each network.
///
/// The `EXTENDED` level has been extracted using the Firehose tracer and all
/// fields are available in this Protobuf.
///
/// The Ethereum block model is used across many chains which means that it
/// happen that certain fields are not available in one chain but are available
/// in another. Each field should be documented when necesssary if it's available
/// on a subset of chains.
///
/// One major concept to get about the Block is the concept of 'ordinal'. The
/// ordinal is a number that is used to globally order every element of execution
/// that happened throughout the processing of the block like
/// \[TransactionTracer\], \[Call\], \[Log\], \[BalanceChange\], \[StateChange\], etc.
/// Element that have a start and end interval, \[Transaction\] and \[Call\], will
/// have two ordinals: `begin_ordinal` and `end_ordinal`. Element that are
/// executed as "point in time" \[Log\], \[BalanceChange\], \[StateChange\], etc. will
/// have only one ordinal named `ordinal`. If you take all of the message in the
/// Block that have an 'ordinal' field in an array and you sort each element
/// against the `ordinal` field, you will get the exact order of execution of
/// each element in the block.
///
/// All the 'ordinal' fields in a block are globally unique for the given block,
/// it is **not** a chain-wide global ordering. Furthermore, caution must be take
/// with reverted elements due to execution failure. For anything attached to a
/// \[Call\] that has a `state_reverted` field set to `true`, the `ordinal` field
/// is not reliable and should not be used to order the element against other
/// elements in the block as those element might have 0 as the ordinal. Only
/// successful calls have a reliable `ordinal` field.

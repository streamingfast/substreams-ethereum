# Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

* **Breaking Change** Fixed generating `Event` and `Function` structs where the ABI has a tuple with 16 fields or more by removing the `PartialEq` outside of the `test` configuration. If you were using `==` to compare your structs, implement a function that compares equality of your events instead.

## [0.9.4](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.9.4)

* Fixed ABI code generator generating invalid code `encode` code when a function has a parameter of type `tuple`.

## [0.9.3](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.9.3)

* Added `timestamp` on `Block` type, returns a reference to the header's timestamp.

* Re-generated Protobuf `Block` type using latest `firehose-ethereum` source, this brings in some missing `BalanceChange#Reason` enum values.

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.9.2)

* Added `parent` on `CallView` to retrieve the parent call of the current `Call` pointed to by `CallView`

* Added `logs_with_calls` on `TransactionTrace` which iterates over the logs of the transaction (excluding those from call that were reverted) and yields each log as a tuple `(&Log, CallView)`.

## [0.9.1](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.9.1)

* Fixed encoding of function when dealing with a `bool` referenced as a sub type (like in a function that accepts `bool[]`).

* Added support for tuple in event in ABI generated code.

* Fixed wrong handling of `FixedArray` when the array element's type is dynamic itself in ABI generated code.

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/streaminfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

* Re-exporting `block_view` from `substreams-ethereum-core`
* Fixed bug in ABI generation where `uint` was not properly handled

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/streaminfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

* Bump `substreams` crate
* Changing `into()` call when converting to `BigInt` in abi to call the proper `signed` or `unsigned` encoding
* Adding `into()` method from `BigInt` to use `unsigned_bytes_be`

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/streaminfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

* Bump `substreams` crate

## [0.6.2](https://github.com/streaminfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.6.2)

* Replacing `EthBigInt` and `ethabi::Uint` to only use `substreams-rs` scalar `BigInt` struct.

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/streaminfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.6.1)

* Made Windows target(s) able to run tests when depending on `substreams-ethereum` crate.

* Adding `allow` attribute(s) to remove warnings for code generated by ABI generator (should be good now).

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/streaminfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

* Bump `substreams` to 0.3.0.

* Adding `allow` attribute(s) to remove warnings for code generated by ABI generator.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/streaminfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

* Bump `substreams`.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

* Fixed decoding of event where some indexed fields were `intN` (`int8` to `int256` by increment of 8).

* Fixed decoding of event where some unindexed fields were fixed array with sub element being dynamic types (`bytes[2]`).

* Fixed decoding of event where some unindexed fields were fixed bytes (`bytes8` to `bytes32`).

* Added RPC batching functionality and the RPCDecodable trait to allow decoding of RPC responses.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* Breaking change
  * Replaced `num_bigint` with `EthBigInt` and `BigInt` from `substreams-rs` crate

## [0.2.2-rc.2](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.2.2-rc.2)

* Fixed issue when type of field was Vec of Uint and the underlying passed in value wasn't cloned. The clone only occurs when it is a Vec<Uint> and not when the type is only a Uint.

## [0.2.2-rc.1](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.2.2-rc.1)

* Fixed issue with dependency with api generation. Semver reference for proper way of importing dependencies.

## [0.2.1-rc](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.2.1-rc)

* Adding ABI function generation first draft

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.2.1)

* Adding tests for decoding of different value types

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

* **Breaking** Replaced `substreams-ethereum/pb::eth::v1` to `substreams-ethereum/pb::eth::v2` (perform a global replace of any references of `substreams-ethereum/pb::eth::v1` to `substreams-ethereum/pb::eth::v2` and don't forget to re-generate ABI bindings also which depends on `substreams-ethereum/pb::eth::v1`).

* **Breaking** `substreams-ethereum/pb::eth::rpc::RpcCall#method_signature` is now named `data`.

* **Breaking** Bumped `prost` to `^0.11.0` (will requires you to bump `substreams = "~0.0.19"`).

* **Breaking** Removed `must_decode` on ABI generated Event code. Instead, use `if let Some(event) = <EventType>::match_and_decode(&log)`. For example, if you had the following code:

  ```
  if !abi::erc721::events::Transfer::match_log(log) {
    return None;
  }

  let transfer = abi::erc721::events::Transfer::must_decode(log);
  ```

  Replace it with

  ```
  if let Some(transfer) = abi::erc721::events::Transfer::match_and_decode(log) {
    // Do something
  }
  ```

## [0.1.9](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.9)

* Fixed packaging issue.

> Skipped `0.1.8` by mistake

## [0.1.7](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.7)

* Bumped `substreams` version to `0.0.17`

## [0.1.6](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.6)

* Bump versions in release and bump substreams create dependency

## [0.1.5](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.5)

* Adding helper functions for block handling (transactions, receipts and logs)
* Rework of crate structure
* Fix bug where underlying `ethabi` library was incorrectly decoding an `int24` to an un-overflowing value. This resulted  in always having a positive number. Switching to using `BigInt`, proper overflowing of int24 value makes it that we can have negative values.
* Changed crate structure to separate `substreams-ethereum-core` from `substreams-ethereum`.
* Added helpers to `pb::Block` and `pb::TransactionTrace` to facilitate iterating over events.
* Removed `Event::must_decode`, use the new `Event::match_and_decode` instead.

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.4)

* Fixed bug when an ABI has multiple times the same Event's name but with a different signature.

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.3)

* Fixed `bytes` usage in Abigen (was generating `address` type).

* Fixed bug on Abigen when event contains unindexed/indexed fields on certain ordering of them.

* Improved generated code for ABI generator for events to `Self` wherever possible.

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.2)

* Bumped to Substreams [0.0.11](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.11).

* `substreams::init` is now always defined and the actual `getrandom` custom registration is conditional based on the platform you compile to. This will enable non `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target to compile which is required for unit testing

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.1)

* Nothing

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-ethereum/releases/tag/0.1.0)

* Added codegen API for ABI bindings that can be used instead of the macro for those who prefer that.

* Added ABI bindings macro `use_contract` (restricted to Events for now).

* Added `NULL_ADDRESS` constant that can be re-used by dependent projects.

* StreamingFast Firehose Block generated Rust code is now included in this library directly.
